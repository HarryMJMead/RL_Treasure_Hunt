# Reinforcement Learning as a Treasure Hunt üèùÔ∏è

## Introduction

## Setup

## How to Play

## Pre/Post Game Script

We provide an example script, `Sript.md`, for introducing the game to new players as well as discussing what they've learned after playing. The idea is that we want to introduce the rules of the game in an engaging and approachable way, as well as giving some hints to point them in the right direction. After the player has completed the game, we take the opportunity to draw a relation to reinforcement learning (again, in a way that is approachable to children).
