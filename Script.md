## Pre-Game:

Ahoy, young explorer! Welcome to our Treasure Island Adventure! 

Today, you're going to become a treasure hunter, and your mission is to find as much hidden gold as possible on this mysterious island. You see this big map here? This is your treasure map; a grid full of squares where each square might hold some precious gold! 

But here's the twist: the gold isn't just scattered randomly. It's hidden near special landmarks like mighty trees, ancient rocks, or mysterious bushes. You’ll have to use your clever thinking to figure out which landmarks the gold might be around. 

Now, you only have a limited number of moves to find the gold, but remember: the gold is hidden in piles around some of these trees, rocks and bushes, so if you find gold, there’s a good chance there’s more gold nearby.

So, ready to put on your explorer's hat and start hunting for gold?

## Post-Game:

Wow, what an adventure you’ve had on Treasure Island! You’ve done an amazing job finding hidden gold. Did you notice how you started to think differently about where to look as you played more? Maybe you found that some landmarks were luckier than others, or perhaps you took a chance on new spots sometimes. 

In the world of smart machines and computers, what you just did is similar to what’s called 'reinforcement learning.' This is a type of learning where computers or robots try things out, see the results, and use that information to make better choices in the future.

So, next time you hear about robots learning tasks or self-driving cars, remember your time as a treasure hunter.

Great job, and use that clever thinking wherever you go.
